# Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

**🔧 This project was developed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology.**  
It showcases a practical implementation of hand gesture classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the LeapGestRecog dataset.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing from a structured image dataset  
- Label encoding and normalization of input images  
- CNN model architecture with convolution, pooling, and dropout layers  
- Model evaluation and visualization of predictions

## 📁 Dataset Used
- **LeapGestRecog** from Kaggle  
- Contains 10 gesture classes across multiple user folders

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- TensorFlow (Keras)  
- scikit-learn
